You could live longer.
Recent studies found that coffee drinkers are less likely to die from some of the leading causes of death in women:
coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.
Your DNA will be stronger.
Dark roast coffee decreases breakage in DNA strands, which occur naturally but can lead to cancer or tumors if not
repaired by your cells.

less likely to develop colorectal cancer.

Almost two-thirds of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease are women.</h5>
